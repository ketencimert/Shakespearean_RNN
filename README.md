# Recurrent Neural Networks

In this assignment, you will experiment with recurrent neural network(RNN).

### Task 1: XOR net

Create a RNN network which can correctly compute the XOR operation.

### Task 2: RNN Application - Char-RNN

In this task, we will implement a very simple application of RNN. Char-RNN is a multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) for training/sampling from character-level language models. In this task, you will learn how to build rnn network and some tricks to help better train it.
